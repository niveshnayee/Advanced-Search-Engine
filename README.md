## ðŸš€ Current Implementation

### ðŸ§  Core Features

- **Profile Scraping & Structuring**  
crawls and structures profile data using custom parsers.

- **Hybrid Search Engine**  
  - **BM25** for precise keyword-based matching  
  - **Semantic Search** using OpenAI embeddings for contextual relevance  

- **GPT-4 Validation Layer**  
  Complex logic verified using GPT-4 API as a reasoning filter.

- **Optimized Pipeline**  
  Precomputes and caches embeddings to boost performance.

## ðŸ§ª Quick Start

Run the system with a sample query:

```bash
# Run with a sample query
python main.py --query "YOUR QUERY" 
```


# Future Development
- Add a vector database for embedding search
